Privacy Policy – [Muzzle]

Effective Date: [Thursday, August 14, 2025]

1. Introduction

This Privacy Policy describes how [Muzzle] ("the Bot", "we", "our", or "us") collects, uses, and protects information when you use our services on the Discord platform. Our primary goal is to ensure the safety and moderation of Discord servers while respecting user privacy.

By using the Bot, you agree to this Privacy Policy.

2. Information We Collect

Message Content:

The Bot processes the content of messages only when necessary for moderation purposes (e.g., checking for blacklisted words, spam, or harmful content).

Message content is not stored permanently. It is processed in memory and discarded immediately after moderation checks are completed.

User Identifiers:

The Bot may temporarily log the User ID of members who trigger moderation actions (e.g., warnings, mutes, message deletions) for record-keeping in moderation logs.

These logs are stored only within Discord channels designated for moderation or short-term server logs, and are never shared outside the server.

3. How We Use Information

We use collected information solely for:

Detecting and removing prohibited content.

Enforcing server rules.

Preventing spam and harmful behavior.

Maintaining community safety.

4. Data Storage and Retention

The Bot does not store message content off-platform (outside Discord).

Moderation logs (User IDs, timestamps, and action details) are retained only for as long as necessary to assist server moderators.

No data is sold, rented, or shared with third parties.

5. Opt-Out

Because moderation is essential for community safety, users cannot opt-out of message checks performed by the Bot in servers where it is active. If you do not wish to be subject to moderation, you may leave the server.

6. Data Sharing

We do not share collected data with any third parties, except when required by law or by a valid request from Discord Trust & Safety.

7. Security

We take reasonable measures to protect any stored data from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction.

8. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes will be posted in the Bot’s official documentation or repository with an updated "Effective Date". Continued use of the Bot after such changes indicates your acceptance of the updated policy.
